This package is a work in progress. Please reach out to the authors
before using.

# Scope

*i2extras* adds additional functionality to the
[incidence2](https://github.com/reconhub/incidence2) package.

# What does it do?

The main features of the package include:

  - `fit_curve()` and `growth_rate()`: fit a trend (poisson / negative
    binomial) to an `incidence2` object and calculate the associated
    growth rate.

  - `add_rolling_average()`: add a rolling average to an `incidence2`
    object.

  - `bootstrap()`: generates a bootstrapped `incidence2` object by
    re-sampling, with replacement, the original dates of events.

  - `find_peak()`: locates the peak time of the epicurve.

  - `estimate_peak()`: uses bootstrap to estimate the peak time (and
    related confidence interval) of a partially observed outbreak.

## Installing the package

Once it is released on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), you will be
able to install the stable version of the package with:

``` r
install.packages("i2extras")
```

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require(remotes)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("reconhub/i2extras", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
