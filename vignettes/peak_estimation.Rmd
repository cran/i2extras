# Bootstrapping and finding peaks

We provide functions to return the peak of the incidence data (grouped or 
ungrouped), bootstrap from the incidence data, and estimate confidence intervals
around a peak.

## `bootstrap()`
```{r bootstrap}
dat <- fluH7N9_china_2013
x <- incidence(dat, date_index = date_of_onset, groups = gender)
bootstrap(x)
```

## `find_peak()`
```{r findpeak}
dat <- fluH7N9_china_2013
x <- incidence(dat, date_index = date_of_onset, groups = gender)

# peaks across each group
find_peak(x)

# peak without groupings
find_peak(regroup(x))
```

## `estimate_peak()`
Note that the bootstrapping approach used for estimating the peak time makes
the following assumptions:

- the total number of event is known (no uncertainty on total incidence);
- dates with no events (zero incidence) will never be in bootstrapped datasets; and
- the reporting is assumed to be constant over time, i.e. every case is
  equally likely to be reported.

```{r estimatepeak}
dat <- fluH7N9_china_2013
x <- incidence(dat, date_index = date_of_onset, groups = province)

# regrouping for overall peak (we suspend progress bar for markdown)
estimate_peak(regroup(x), progress = FALSE)

# across provinces
estimate_peak(x, progress = FALSE)
```
